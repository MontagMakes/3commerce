# 3Commerce: C2C Ecommerce App with 3D Integration (Flutter-based Graduation Project)

## Overview
3Commerce is a customer-to-customer (C2C) ecommerce app developed as part of my graduation project. The app allows users to browse, purchase, and sell products with the added feature of 3D product visualization. Built with Flutter, this project demonstrates my skills in mobile app development, integrating Firebase for user authentication, real-time data management, and cloud storage. The project is not published, and it's intended to showcase my development skills.

## Key Features
- **Firebase Authentication**: Secure user login and registration, using Firebase for seamless authentication.
- **Firebase Firestore**: Real-time database for managing user data, product listings, and order history.
- **Firebase Storage**: Cloud storage for product images and optional 3D models (in GLB format).
- **3D Product Viewing**: Users can view products in 3D (if available) before making a purchase decision.
- **Product Listing**: Users can upload their own products, including images and optional 3D models in GLB format.
- **Shopping Cart & Checkout**: Users can add products to their cart and proceed with the checkout process.
- **Order History**: Users can view their order history after completing purchases.

2. **Browse Products**: Users can browse products listed by other users, with an option for 3D viewing if available.
3. **Add to Cart**: Users can add products to their cart and proceed to checkout.
4. **Order Completion**: After checkout, the order is processed and added to the user's order history.
5. **Product Upload**: Users can upload their products by providing a product image and, optionally, a 3D model in GLB format.
6. **Logout**: Users can log out of the app.
